== NAME

nng_tcp_getopt - get option from TCP connection

== SYNOPSIS

[source, c]
----
#include <nng/nng.h>
#include <nng/supplemental/tcp/tcp.h>

int nng_tcp_getopt(nng_tcp *conn, const char *name, void *data, size_t *sizep);
----

== DESCRIPTION

The `nng_tcp_getopt()` is used to retrieve the value of the option _name_ for
the <<nng_tcp.5#,TCP connection>> _conn_.
The size of the buffer located at _data_ to receive the copy is passed by the
caller at the location referenced by _sizep_.
If this size is sufficient to hold the entire object, the object is copied into
the buffer specified by _data_.
In either event, the size of the source object (the amount of data copied,
or that would have been copied if sufficient space were available) is stored
at the location of _sizep_.

=== Options

The options specifically suppported for retrieval from TCP connections are:

* <<nng_options.5#NNG_OPT_LOCADDR,`NNG_OPT_LOCADDR`>>
* <<nng_options.5#NNG_OPT_REMADDR,`NNG_OPT_REMADDR`>>
* <<nng_tcp_options.5#NNG_OPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE,`NNG_OPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE`>>
* <<nng_tcp_options.5#NNG_OPT_TCP_NODELAY,`NNG_OPT_TCP_NODELAY`>>

== RETURN VALUES

This function returns 0 on success, and non-zero otherwise.

== ERRORS

[horizontal]
`NNG_ECLOSED`:: The connection _conn_ is closed.
`NNG_EINVAL`:: There was insufficient space to receive the object.
	The amount of data actually needed is returned in _sizep_.
`NNG_ENOTSUP`:: The option _name_ is not supported.
`NNG_EWRITEONLY`:: The option _name_ may not read.
